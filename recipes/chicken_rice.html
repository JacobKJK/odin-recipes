        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Boil a large pot of water. In the meantime, clean the chicken by 
                exfoliating with kosher or coarse salt. Rinse chicken well, inside 
                and outside.
            </li>
            <li>
                PRE-BOIL CHICKEN: When water is at a hard boil, add the chicken. 
                Return to hard boil, let scum come to the surface. Boil for 5 minutes. 
                Discard all the water, including the scum.    
            </li>
            <li>
                Refill pot with clean water to cover the chicken by 1-inch, and add 
                in the garlic, green onion and ginger. Bring the pot to a boil over 
                high heat, then immediately turn the heat to low to keep a simmer. 
                Cook for about 30 minutes more (less if you're using a smaller chicken). Check for doneness by sticking a chopstick into the flesh under the leg and see if the juices run clear or insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh not touching bone. It should read 160F. The chicken will continue to cook to 165F during rest. 
            </li>
            <li>
                When the chicken is cooked through, turn off the heat and remove the 
                pot from the burner. Immediately lift and transfer the chicken into 
                a bath of ice water to cool. The quick cooling will stop the cooking 
                process, keeping the meat soft and tender, and giving the skin a 
                lovely firm texture. After cooling, pat the chicken dry with paper 
                towels and rub the sesame oil all over the chicken. This will help 
                prevent the chicken from drying out.
